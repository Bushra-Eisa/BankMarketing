Proposed Approach:

Using a machine learning algorithm, we will be able to create a list of customers who are more likely to buy the product. This is based on multiple parameters like their job, housing, and loans. This algorithm will be able to predict ideal customers thus allowing the bank to focus its resources on customers who would be interested in buying their product instead of wasting time.

Develop machine learning model to:

•	Select customers that may buy the products.

•	Use minimum set of resources and save time to select candidate customers

•	Increase business profits.

By using available datasets and apply machine learning algorithm to automate process of customer selection, the candidate customers will be identified easily. No need to use any resources in customer’s side.  Only in server side we need to run software.
